# Life_Expectancy
As mentioned by (Roser, et al., 2013), life expectancy is one of the most important tools that are is used to test the population health, it gives indication regarding the expected average age of the death in population. When comparing the life expectancy globally, although it has developed widely, it can be noticed that it is differ between countries, because many countries are suffering from issues (war, lake of resources, etc.) that led to bad health situation. In addition to this, the average life expectancy is affected by number of factors such as disease, the location of that country, alcohol, etc. Figure 1 shows the life expectancy globally in 2019.

1.2 Aim and objectives
This work aim to study the feasibility of predicting the factors that play major role in life expectancy globally based backward elimination algorithm. This aim will be achieved by the below objectives:
1.	Understand the factors that might lead to increase or decrease life expectancy. 
2.	Use algorithm of backward elimination to build the prediction model.
3.	Provide recommendations for further improvements.
